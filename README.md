    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import groupEntriesBy from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-group-entries-by@deno/mod.js';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the deno branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/array-base-group-entries-by/tags). For example,

```javascript
import groupEntriesBy from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-group-entries-by@v0.1.0-deno/mod.js';
```

#### groupEntriesBy( x, indicator\[, thisArg] )

Groups element entries according to an indicator function.

```javascript
function indicator( v ) {
    return v[ 0 ];
}

var x = [ 'beep', 'boop', 'foo', 'bar' ];

var out = groupEntriesBy( x, indicator );
// returns { 'b': [ [ 0, 'beep' ], [ 1, 'boop' ], [ 3, 'bar' ] ], 'f': [ [ 2, 'foo' ] ] }
```

An `indicator` function is provided the following arguments:

-   **value**: current array element.
-   **index**: current array element index.
-   **arr**: input array.

To set the `indicator` function execution context, provide a `thisArg`.

```javascript
function indicator( v ) {
    this.count += 1;
    return v[ 0 ];
}

var x = [ 'beep', 'boop', 'foo', 'bar' ];

var context = {
    'count': 0
};
var out = groupEntriesBy( x, indicator, context );
// returns { 'b': [ [ 0, 'beep' ], [ 1, 'boop' ], [ 3, 'bar' ] ], 'f': [ [ 2, 'foo' ] ] }

var cnt = context.count;
// returns 4
```

## Notes

-   The value returned by an `indicator` function should be a value which can be serialized as an object key. As a counterexample,

    ```javascript
    function indicator( v ) {
        return {};
    }
    var x = [ 'beep', 'boop', 'foo', 'bar' ];

    var out = groupEntriesBy( x, indicator );
    // returns { '[object Object]': [ [ 0, 'beep' ], [ 1, 'boop' ], [ 2, 'foo' ], [ 3, 'bar' ] ] }
    ```

    while each group identifier is unique, all input array elements resolve to the same group because each group identifier serializes to the same string.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
import discreteUniform from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/random-array-discrete-uniform@deno/mod.js';
import take from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-take@deno/mod.js';
import groupEntriesBy from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-group-entries-by@deno/mod.js';

function indicator( v ) {
    // Use the first letter of each element to define groups:
    return v[ 0 ];
}

// Define an initial array of values:
var values = [ 'beep', 'boop', 'foo', 'bar', 'woot', 'woot' ];

// Sample from the initial array to generate a random collection:
var indices = discreteUniform( 100, 0, values.length-1, {
    'dtype': 'generic'
});
var x = take( values, indices );
// returns [...]

// Group the values:
var out = groupEntriesBy( x, indicator );
// returns {...}

console.log( out );
```
